# Introduction to Amazon Web Services

## Introduction

In this module you will learn how to:

- Summarize the **benefits** of AWS
- Describe differences between **on-demand delivery and cloud deployments**
- Summarize the **pay-as-you-go** pricing model

<br />

**AWS Service Offerings**

- Compute
- Storage
- Network Security
- Blockchain
- Machine Learning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Robot Development

- Commentary by me: AWS Focus on "pay as you go" model, which is basically a model that you only pay for the services that you use. Different from on premises model, with Cloud/AWS, you can get resources and remove them with "a snap of fingers" or a few clicks.

<br />

**What is a client-server model**

- In computing, a **client** can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with, to make requests to compute servers. A **server** can be services such as amazon elastic compute cloud (amazon ec2), a type of a virtual server.

- For example, suppose that a client makes a request for a news article, the score in an online game, or a funny video. The server evaluates the details of this request and fulfills it by returning the information to the client.

<br />

**Cloud Computing**

- The **on-demand delivery** of **I.T. resources over the internet** with **pay-as-you-go** pricing.

- Commentary by me:

  - **On-Demand** means that AWS can give the resources when I need it. And I can return the resources back to AWS when I want.

  - **I.T. resources** -> AWS Deals with the **undifferentiated heavy lifting of it**, (often repetitive, and time consuming, e.g.: provisioning servers, installing sql database softwares, and other things).

  - **Over the internet** -> Free available way of interacting with the resources (via console or programmatically (as via cli, for example)). No sales call needed.

  - **Pay-as-you-go** -> Pay only for what you use and **when** you use it.

<br />

**Deployment Models For Cloud Computing**

- When selecting a cloud strategy, a company must consider factors such as required cloud application components, preferred resource management tools, and many legacy I.T. infrastructure requirements.

- The three cloud computing deployment models are cloud-based, on premises, and hybrid.

- **Cloud-based Deployment**

  - Run all parts of the application in the cloud
  - Migrate existing applications to the cloud
  - Design and build new applications in the cloud
  - In a **cloud-based deployment** model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new applications in the cloud. You can byukd those applications in the infrastructure that requires your I.T. staff to manage them. Alternatively, you can build them using higher-level services that reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure.

- **On-Premises Deployment**

  - Deployment resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
  - Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.
  - **On-premises deployment** is also known as a private cloud deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.
  - For example, you might have applications that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center. Though this model, is much like legacy I.T. infrastructure, its incorporation of application management and virtualization technologies helps to increases resource utilization.

- **Hybrid Development**
  - Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastrucure
  - Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy applications
  - In a **hybrid deployment**, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. You might want to use this approach in a number of situations. For example, you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations requires your business to keep certain records on premises.
  - For example, suppose that a company wants to tuse cloud services that can automate batch data processing and analytics. However, the company has several legacy applications that are mode suitable on premises and will not be migrated to the cloud. With a hybrid deployment, the company would be able to keep the legacy applications on premises while benefiting from the data and analytics services that run in the cloud.

**Benefits of cloud computing**

- Consider why a company might choose to take a particular cloud computing approach when addressing business needs:
  - Trade upfront expenses for variable expense
  - Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
  - Stop guessing capacity
  - Benefit from massive economies of scale
  - Increase speed and agility
  - Go global in minutes
